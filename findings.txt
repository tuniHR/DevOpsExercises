While containers allow for separation of processes from host system and provides and isolated runtime environment, some things are shared 
among all containers. Each container runs in isolation and does not have access to other containers but share some of the host systems resources.
This is indicated that when querying processes, each container reports its own but does not report the other's processes.

Containers are not full virtual machines, and rely on host kernel, which reduces overhead and makes containers more lightweight solution. 
Containers share internal network, which can also be opened to be accessed from outside the containers by the host system. This means networking 
resources are shared among the containers as well. Also in this exercise containers report same available diskspace and uptime, which indicates that 
they share filesystem and system resources which are provided by the host system.
